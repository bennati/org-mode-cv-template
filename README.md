# org-mode-cv-template
A CV and cover letter template done with Org Mode and Latex

The template is designed to be edited with Emacs: Org Mode allows to easily include, exclude and move entries around.

Org Mode's "org-babel-tangle" will export the template in LaTeX format.
If you don't want to use Emacs, simply edit the .latex file
